The AI engineer successfully built a FoodPanda-like mobile application from scratch, iteratively adding features and addressing user-reported bugs. Initial setup involved configuring the Expo frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database. Key features like multi-role authentication (Customer, Restaurant, Rider, Admin), Google OAuth, and email/password login were implemented. The development process was driven by user feedback, fixing UI issues like React Navigation theming, non-clickable elements, and web-compatibility for alerts. Backend issues, such as JSON serialization and duplicate keyword arguments, were also resolved. The app's core ordering, profile management, and admin monitoring functionalities were established. The last task involved fixing a Rider profile not found error during Accept Delivery, where the backend was updated to ensure rider profiles are created on registration. The backend was reloaded, and a summary was about to be generated.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a mobile application similar to FoodPanda in the Philippines, enabling online ordering from stores/restaurants and delivery via booked riders. Explicit requirements included Google social login, traditional email/password login, GCash payment integration, and full backend support. The application needs to support three primary user roles: Customer (ordering), Restaurant (managing orders/menu), and Delivery Rider (accepting/delivering orders), and an Admin role for monitoring activities. A delivery fee structure of 25% (10% rider, 15% application) was specified. The application is built using Expo for cross-platform mobile and web compatibility, with a FastAPI backend and MongoDB database.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: Expo, React Native, Expo Router (file-based routing), React Navigation (theming, stack/tab navigation), Zustand (state management),  (API calls).
- **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB (database),  (ORM),  (password hashing),  (JWT),  (Google OAuth, GCash).
- **Cross-platform Development**: Platform-specific logic (e.g.,  vs ), responsive design.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application has a monorepo structure with  (FastAPI) and  (Expo/React Native) directories at the root level ().



-   : Main FastAPI application, defines all API endpoints for user authentication, management, restaurants, menus, orders, and rider assignments. Crucial for data persistence and business logic. Recent changes included fixing JSON serialization, handling timezone-naive datetimes, and correcting order creation logic (removing duplicate  passing). Also updated to ensure rider profiles are created upon registration.
-   : Script to populate the MongoDB database with initial user, restaurant, and menu data for testing.
-   : Script to create a default admin user for initial access to the admin dashboard.
-   : Expo configuration file, includes app name, scheme, icons, and platform-specific settings. Recently updated for QuickBite branding.
-   : Manages all frontend dependencies. Updated for various libraries including , , and other core Expo/React Native components.
-   : Root layout for Expo Router, handles global context, authentication state (), and . Critical for app-wide navigation and theming. Was updated multiple times to fix theming issues and  import paths.
-   : Login screen, supports both Google social login and email/password login. Recently updated to include a regular sign-in button.
-   : Customer profile screen. Contains menu items (Edit Profile, Saved Addresses, etc.) and a logout button. Significantly modified to make menu items clickable and fix  for web compatibility.
-   : New screen created for updating user profile information.
-   : Dynamic route for displaying details of a single restaurant. Created to resolve unmatched route errors when clicking restaurants.
-   : Checkout page, calculates and displays delivery fees (10% rider, 15% app). Modified to resolve unmatched route and to ensure the Place Order button functions correctly, including enhanced error logging and style adjustments.
-   : Dynamic route for displaying details of a specific order. Created to resolve unmatched route errors when clicking pending orders.
-   : Rider dashboard, lists orders available for pickup. Modified to fix  for web compatibility on the Accept Delivery action.
-   : Zustand store managing user authentication state, including  object and . Updated to support the 'admin' role.
-   : Custom component to provide a consistent theme for React Navigation across the application. Created to centralize theme logic and fix theming issues.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Fully integrate GCash payment.
- Implement full functionality for all profile sub-pages (e.g., Saved Addresses, Payment Methods).
- Develop comprehensive Restaurant and Rider specific screens beyond placeholders.
- Verify Accept Delivery functionality after the Rider profile not found fix.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer was actively engaged in fixing issues reported by the user regarding the Accept Delivery functionality for riders. The user reported, there is an error in accepting delivery and provided a screenshot indicating Rider profile not found. The AI engineer correctly identified that rider profiles were not being created automatically during user registration.

The solution involved modifying the backend file  to ensure that a rider profile is generated when a new user registers with the  role. After applying this fix, the backend service was restarted to implement the changes. The agent's last action was to prepare a summary of this fix, indicating the immediate task was concluded, but the functionality still needs re-verification by the user.

<optional_next_step>
Verify if the Accept Delivery button for riders is now functional after the Rider profile not found fix.
